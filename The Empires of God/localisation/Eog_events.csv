EVTDESCEoG.30;All the guests have arrived and the Conference of Peace can finally begin. You expose to the Conference the first problem: it is the fate of the state known as Holy Roman Empire. In your opinion the solution is easy and no matter of discussion! Only an Emperor shall exist in the West and that man is you.\nYou ask - or better command - to the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire to abdicate. In a gesture of good will you permit to him to hold the more humble title of "King of Germania". Some mourmour can be heard in the hall but no one dares to oppose you. The Conference of Peace has taken its first decision.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTOKSQPREoG.30;I am the Emperor... ehm Consul of the West!;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTOKEREEoG.30;I am the Emperor of the East and the West!;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEoG.31;The Conference of Peace has taken his decision: you should abdicate as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the only title that will remain for you is the title of King of Germania. You give an hasty look to [From.GetTitledFirstName] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and remove the Crown from your head and restituite it to the Pope together with the regalia of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAEoG.31;I will never forget this day!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEoG.32;Today in the Conference of Peace has been decided that the Holy Roman Empire shall not exist anymore, a new State that will be known as Kingdom of Germania will be created on his ashes. The Emperor has restituited the Crown and the Regalia of the Empire to the Pope and has accepted the Crown of Germania for him and his descendent. A new chapter of the History of Western Europe now begin!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA.32;As The Conference of Peace has decided;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCEoG.37;Finally the Holy Roman Empire does not exist anymore and you suddenly realize that does not makes sense that the King of Germany is your liege and of the other Princes of North Italy. Maybe you could obtain independence but, in any case, to become vassal of S·P·Q·R will be more acceptable that being the one of a foreign King. You sat on your chair and start to speak to the Conference, sure that this moment will be part of the future History books.;;;;;;;;;x
