# Added on_attacker_leader_death, on_defender_leader_death and on_thirdparty_death, which all trigger when corresponding character dies

# attacker, defender, thirdparty(only valid if thirdparty character is involved), thirdparty_title(only valid if thirdparty title is involved)

# ai_will_do: modifies value AI places on the CB compared to other CBs (default: 1)
# can_use_gui: If otherwise valid, the CB is listed in the Diplo View, but you can't declare war unless 'can_use_gui' is also valid (also shows a trigger tooltip.)
